README
======

This template reproduces the MS Word equivalent for the Openlab summer students
report. Maybe with this template we can avoid the msword usage that is very
complicated to learn for a pure latex user.

Also a template for the beamer presentation was added. Right now it works out of
the box.

There are two example codes available you can use to see how the templates work.

Diferences
----------

1. The Arial font have been substituted for Helvica that looks very similar but
   is free and available by default in all Linux systems.
2. The foot rule that is gray in the original templated looks more dark here.

Any bug report or improve will be welcome.

PD: If you like to add some documentation it will be also very welcome.
