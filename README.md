# README #

This template reproduces the MS Word one for Openlab summer students report. Maybe with this template we can avoid the msword usage that is very complicated to learn for a pure latex user.

Also a template for the beamer presentation was added. Right now it works out of the box.

## Diferences ##
1. The Arial font have been substituted for Helvica that looks very similar but is free and available by default in all Linux systems.
2. The foot rule that is gray in the original templated looks more dark here.

Any bug report or improve will be welcome.

Inform it to: kratsbinovish@gmail.com.

PD: If you like to add some documentation is also very welcome.
